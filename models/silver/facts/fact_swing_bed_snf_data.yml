    description: >
      Fact table containing swing bed SNF quality measures by provider and 
      reporting period. Provider attributes (e.g., name, address, CMS region) 
      are stored with each row for simplicity, despite some redundancy. 
      This decision prioritizes clarity over normalization given the relatively 
      small size and narrow scope of this table.
