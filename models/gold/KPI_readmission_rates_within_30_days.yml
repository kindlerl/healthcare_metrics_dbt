      To be able to accurately calculate this KPI, we would need:

      Patient-level readmission events ❌
      Admission and discharge dates ❌
      Diagnosis category ❌
      Time-series data (minimum 30 day window) ❌
      Readmission indicators ❌

      Since we do not have any of the required metrics, we cannot complete the KPI
      as requested.

      HOWEVER, as an alternative (proxy), we can provide information that has already
      been pre-aggregated and standardized.  There are 2 tables that capture 
      readmission rates as a general metric:

          • fact_snf_vbp_facility_performance
          • dim_snf_vbp_aggregate_performance_metrics

      Pull the relative columns from these tables 

    columns:
      - name: provider_id
        description: Provider ID of specific provider
      - name: provider_name
        description: Provider name
      - name: state
        description: 2 character abbreviation for each state represented
      - name: baseline_readmission_rate
        description: Aggregated baseline readmission rate, provided as source data
      - name: performance_readmission_rate
        description: Aggregated performance readmission rate, provided as source data
