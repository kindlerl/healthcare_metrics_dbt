      Definition for occupancy rate:

      Occupancy_Rate = (Total_Patients / Total_Beds_Available) * 100

      Total_Patients = mds_census (fact_provider_daily_staffing)
      Total_Beds_Avaiable = number_of_certified_beds (dim_provider)
      
      Computed by hospital, state, and month.

      HOWEVER, based on current data availability, the staffing fact table
      (fact_provider_daily_staffing) only provides data for a single date
      (1970-08-23), so we cannot produce any meaningful montyly or quarterly
      data.  The current output only reflects occupancy for that specific date.
