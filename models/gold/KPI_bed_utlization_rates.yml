    description: >
      This KPI is intended to show bed utilization by hospital and department.
      Bed utilization is calculated as:
      (Total Patients / Certified Beds) * 100

      HOWEVER, the dataset does not contain any department-level granularity.
      Therefore, this KPI can only be calculated at the hospital level.
      The current output reflects bed utilization per facility.
      Department-level breakdown is unavailable in the current data.
