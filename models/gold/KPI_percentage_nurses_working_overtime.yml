    description: >
      Percentage of nuses working overtime by provider, state, and month.

      Since the data does not reflect individual nurse metrics, we are 
      creating a proxy using a standard calculation of:

      Overtime_Hours = Total_Contractor_Hours / Total_Nurse_Hours

      Contractors (_CTR columns) are typically used when staff (_EMP columns)
      are overextended.  This can be used as a proxy for overtime.

    columns:
      - name: provider_id

      - name: provider_name
        description: Name of the provider
      - name: state
