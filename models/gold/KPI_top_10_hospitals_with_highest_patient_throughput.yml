      NOTE: Throughput requires a date range to track patient movement over time.
      Since the available data only includes a single day (1970-08-23),
      this metric cannot be accurately computed as intended.

      The query below represents a SNAPSHOT of the top 10 facilities with the
      highest patient count on that single day

        description: Provider name
      - name: state
