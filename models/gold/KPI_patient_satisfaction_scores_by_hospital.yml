    description: >
      There is no direct patient satisfaction survey data, so we'll use the
      ratings available in our dim_provider_ratings table, focusing on 3
      specific ratings:
        • overall_rating
        • short_stay_qm_rating
        • long_stay_qm_rating

      This KPI is more of a summary table rather than a trending table.
      
      +-------------+---------------+-------+----------------+-------------------+------------------+
      | Provider ID | Provider Name | State | Overall Rating | Short-Stay Rating | Long-Stay Rating |
      +-------------+---------------+-------+----------------+-------------------+------------------+

      Filter out rows where all 3 rating columns are null to limit clutter.
